### No need for a proxy. ⚠️
### Please leave a star for the project. This project is free and open source. ⭐ You can leave a star from the top right. ⭐..


This software allows you to send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a proxy. The way it works is through Selenium, which enters proxy sites, types the channel name, and then reduces the stream quality to 160p. This allows you to connect to the live stream as a viewer through a proxy without having to pay for one..

- The working logic is simple. croxyproxy is a proxy website that connects to the website you want with proxies, and this code automates the process with Selenium.

⚠️ it is recommended to use this software on another computer (not the one you are streaming from) or on a computer with a large amount of RAM because it opens a lot of hidden tabs in the background and can send as many viewers as you want to the stream

```
## Usage ⚙️

- **After completing the installation process, make sure that you have successfully installed the chromedriver.**


- **Then run the run.bat file or double click the main.py file.**

- **After opening the program, you need to select a proxy server 1 2 3... select the desired proxy server by entering the numbers (recommended proxy server 1. it is a proxy server)**

- **Enter your channel name (example: kichi779) and then enter how many viewers you want to send. if you want to send 20, it is recommended to write 30**

# Usage recommendations 📖

- This system opens multiple background sites, so make sure you have plenty of RAM or perform this operation on an unused computer. (It could be on a powerful virtual server.)

- If the audience delivery takes too long and sends only a few viewers, close the client and reopen it, then repeat the same steps. (Proxy sites can sometimes slow down.)
